        our services are right for you:
        <ul>
            <li>Does it seem like you don't have time to inspect all your returns?</li>
            <li>
                Are your returns shipping from the US to another country before
                they can be resold?
            </li>
            <li>
                Do you lack staff who can test your returned items to make sure they work?
            </li>
            <li>
                Are returned items clogging up your warehouse?
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>


    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>
        Outsourcing your return handling is easy! This process works like this:
        
        <ol>
            <li>
                Your customers send returned products directly to us
            </li>
            <li>
                We service your returned items according to your needs    
            </li>
            <li>
                We ship your completed inventory from our warehouse as-needed
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    
    <h2>Return Handling Services</h2>
    <p>
        We provide customizable levels of return handling services.
    </p>
    <h3>Level 1: Receive and Forward Returns</h3>
    <p>
        Your returned items ship to us, where we:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Send you an automatic email when your package arrives
            </li>
            <li>
                We consolidate your returned items and ship them back to you.
            </li>
        </ol>        
    </p>
    <p>
        This level of service is a great way to save on shipping charges, as your
        returned merchandise is consolidated at our location in Cincinnati, OH 
        before being shipped back to you.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Level 2: Inspect Returned Items</h3>
    <p>
        Your returns ship directly to us where we inspect each item to make sure
        your end-buyer returned the correct item, undamaged.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Issue Refunds With Confidence</h4>
    <p>
        We notify you at each step of the inspection process enabling you
        to refund customers more accurately. You will receive an email each
        time we receive one of your returns.
    </p>
    <p>
        If we find any of the following problems with your returns you're
        notified:
        <ul>
            <li>Missing parts / components</li>
            <li>Damaged items</li>
            <li>Wrong item returned</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h3>Level 3: Test &amp; Recondition</h3>
    <p>
        Our premium return handling service includes everything from Inspection,
        plus we fully test and recondition each of your items.
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>We test each feature of the item to make sure it works perfectly</li>
            <li>
                We recondition your item for highest resale value.
                <p>
                    This includes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cleaning any dust or debris</li>
                    <li>Replacing damaged packaging</li>
                    <li>Replacing missing or damaged components</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Get your items back to market</h4>
    <p>
        We grade each of your items using the same condition guidelines as
        Amazon. Our inventory management system allows you to search and 
        track your returned items at every step of the return handling process.
    </p>
    <p>
        Completed items are all graded with conditions such as "New", "Used - Like New",
        or "Defective or Damaged", along with a comment describing any issues
        with the product.
    </p>
    <p>
        With our system you can directly relist your completed items to Amazon
        or ship your items anywhere in the world using our our 
        <a href="/shipping">discounted FedEx and USPS rates</a>.
